<@324018941221535744>
i get why it leaks
also why tf is this an unsafe memory access

or what this is used for
i have no idea why this is true

like
```
class Square {
  private:
    int s1;
    int s2;
    int s3;

  public:
    int perimeter(int s1, int s2, int s3){
      return s1+s2+s3;
    }
}
```

why is the call
Square::perimeter(1,2,3)
class Square {

}
if the class is square
why is it correct to be like
a member function
say i create
<@352838592349077504>
they're not hiring me
so i'm done
then i think i solved a problem in O(n^3) wtf
which i got half right
then i got a 1D dynamic programming problem
no
i think i guessed the multiple choice right tho
no fucking shot
but caches
i took my best guess
like i know TCP vs UDP kinda
they asked about caching and TCP/IP
by a hackerrank
slammed
i just got
and TCP/IP
LRU FIFO MIN
do u know anything about cache algorithms
<@352838592349077504>
but you declare like int* because it makes it easier to keep track of
void*
aren't all pointers just
apparently that was wrong
bruh
i think i got it
actually
i need to
okay

is there only one type of pointer

:D
c++
<@352838592349077504>
<@324018941221535744>
and therefore once the destructor is called i have a pointer to nothing
or is this a shallow copy
<@352838592349077504>
can i not assign things to dereferenced this
where i think my code is going wrong
this is the only place
because
does this cause a segmentation fault

is a segmentation fault
wtf
<@352838592349077504>
CAO
.

wtf are friends
also
but that's gross and cringe
and i'm actually going to need pointers
the problem is when we get to linked lists and stuff
but i know java
yeah
for loops are the same
like the rest of the code i lowkey just code in java syntax
but in c++
the logic for any other code
bc it's just
but like i can freestyle it enough
(i don't go to lecture)
like i missed the lecture on pointers
message is an attribute
like wtf
and the var&
i can't with the *ptr and the &var
this language is so hard
man
so i can just message.length()
lmfao
o
just when i woulid use this. in java
i don't actually have to use this-> for everything right
also
so bad
it's just
unluck
o
i know
yeah
right
.
.
.
the rest of the program doesn't use them
why tf did he give us sample accessors then
bruh

it's better just to call the private variable right
you want to call a private variable
but in a member function
public accessor
an accessor
you have
if
<@352838592349077504>
and call the copy constructor
i want to get the object
no
does that work
i‚Äôm trying to make a copy
<@352838592349077504>
does that even mean
what
also does this work...............

?
int b = *p
i would like
if i wanted to get the value of a
so p is the memory address to a
uh
int* p = &a
int a = 5
so if i
i have no idea how references and pointers work
also
why.
WHAT
what...
```ShirtOrder( string region, int orderYear, int orderMonth, int orderDay, char printMethod, string message,  int mediums, int larges, int xls, string shirtColor,  string inkColor,  string nameAndEmail ) : region(region), orderYear(orderYear), orderMonth(orderMonth),```
this is how you're supposed to do it

that
you're telling me
wait...
is there no other way to do this...

i have to this->orderYear = 2023;
so this doesn't do anything
wait wtf

and do i need pointers
why does this stuff not work

how tf do you do that in c++
```
public class Hi {
  public int i;
  public Hi (int i) {
    this.i = i;
  }
}
```
i can do
that i want a constructor for
if i have a class
they do
good languages
you know how in
<@352838592349077504>
NO

doing it for the roblox admin badge

it is right
is O(n^2 * log(n)) a thing
<@352838592349077504>
there's no reason to do it in c++
substrings are different
and Collections.sort();
and stuff like Arrays.sort();
i know built in java classes like HashMap
syntax is almost the same but not quite
pointers and references are confusing
we haven't learned ds
in c++
zero things
i can do
matters by extension
time complexity
:(
runtime does matter
:(
i have hackerrank
why tf would i use objects
it's a scripting language
i've never done data structures in python
more comfortable in java
coding interviews
bc
'doesn't work
and it
is my code
the top one
lists
or not strings
are arrays passed differently than strings
i know how quicksort works like why is it not working
bruh
WTF
IT DOESNT WORK
in this implementation
wtf is the difference

<@352838592349077504>
how
wut
is there a way to logic that or is that just memorization‚Ä¶
climbing 1 or 2 stairs
also fibonacci sequence question
?
instead of O(n*m) it‚Äôs O(n+m)
?
bc then you can calculate in constant time
it‚Äôs better to prefixsum
if you have a lot of iterative queries
like do u remember the highway distance problem
i understand
i think
essentially
is
what i‚Äôm getting at
but i don't know why it would be used
given an array i can calc prefix sun
like i don't even know how they work
how and why to use prefix sums
can you explain
<@352838592349077504>
of algorithms
space complexity
do i need
intern question

also this

An abstraction is a model of an object used for computing.
<@352838592349077504> t/f
wtf
is that
what
?????
->
what the FUCK is this

is it true
......
waht tf does this question even meaN

WTF IS A FRIEND FUNCTION
this is right right
i fucking hate this class

obojectively
doesn't exist
which
and imagine the answer is just mutator
i think it's default right
this class is weird
idk bruh
<@352838592349077504>
halp

to society
menace
remember my O(n) peek
i can do the funny empty switch
or
binary
what are those operators called
sorry not bitwise
and a million bitwise ands
if (shirtType != 's' && ...)
it'd be
yeah but like
if i just take out the commented lines
how bad of coding practice is this

i just have to validate the data
so i put it in a function
but i have another algorithm to do the calculations for me now bc we're allowed to use functions
this was it originally

like the user has a few options
to see if chars are equivalent
chars
right
i have to validate data
so
this isn't real output it's a text file
typo?
idk
like
one of them is off by 6000 somehow
what gives

here are test inputs

leads to the incorrect answer
my multiplying a double by a double
so for some reason
double precision right
bruh
yeah
right
i just mormal
i just need to read the value
yeah
access only
no
pass it normally
or can i just
do i have to pass as reference
i'm passing an int or something
i have a primitive type
and pass parameters
to cerate a function
let's say i have
what's a
imagine
lmao
bro i don't want to make all of that
are both stupid
and c++
bc java
const
sorry
...
in snake case
also isn't it good practice to syntax final variables as all caps...
:D
and instead we do parallel array
how about we don't do oop
except no
and what objects are
we've been taught oop
like
that just are attributes to objects
parallel arrays to store data
because we use
monkey school doesn't
clearly
but
i do
yk
prof said no </3
lmao
i just deal in massive amounts of constants
intro cs moment

lmao
and i could be outed for cheating
what if we haven't learned that yet
macro
wtf
global variable i think it's called
is it bad practice to declare them outside of all of the functions
that i use for multiple methods
say i have constant variables
is it bad coding practice
forgot to read documentation
lmao
o what
or do i have to reinitialize
can i just be year = null;
so if i have vector<int> year
or do i pop until empty
can i insta-empty a vector by setting it to null
you have a vector
in c++
to clear the stack you pop until empty
so if you have a stack
again
c++
<@352838592349077504>

lmfao

i missing insertion operator
o i figured it out
the line of code isn't even coding
bro wtf

```
do {
}
while ();

or 

do {
} while();
```
what better syntax

*from other things*
delete data
in c++
you can just
wait
uhhhhhhhh
can i just age = 1
let's say i pass int& age
do i have to do something with the vairable name
when i do something with the variable
right
so if i pass reference variable as a parameter
wait
stupider
it'sd just
of parallel arrays
what's the point
like
?
O(1) accessing and mutating attributes
no?
an array of objects
just use
index refers to one entity
name[0] = andrew; age[0] = 19;
objects
when you could have
why use a parallel array
like
a memory thing
is parallel arrays
also also
memory management overrated
also
bruh
.
lowkey stupid
that's
a
we learned about this in ap cs
right
okay nvm them lmao
i thought u couldn't mutate a parameter
wait they do
unlucky
o
c++ superior?
wait
lowkey intelligent
that's actually
and it actually changes
within the method
i can mutate the variable
means
so reference varaible
<@352838592349077504>

(also they code in java)
i didn't even think it wa s possible
rutgers is better than this
i hate this class
my fucking points
should i email him
.
right
right?
right
doesn't that defeat the purpose of private vairable
can't you do that
through a
you could access it
if you knew the memory location
like theoretically
is it weird c++ memory stuff
i don't get it
??????
ARE YOU ACCESSING
WHAT OTHER OBJECT
like if you use the dot operator
i know how to code better than this clown
bro i stg
I DON"T KNOW LMAO
BRUH LIKE
what is this fucking class
BRUH
?????????

IT"S TRUE????
?????
is this true or false
"A member function called on one instance of a class may access that instance's private member variables, but may not access the private member variables of any other instance of the class."
and is this true
A function whose definition appears inside the class declaration is called a(n) 
inline
 function.
wtf is an inline fun ctinos

<@&851598406954647552>
rotating pirate ship
this is bad
yeah
????????
more or less the same
is different versions of the same compiler
on my pc
use the same compiler
so i need to
okay wait
that's so studpi
why
how does this work
<@352838592349077504>
.
they handle differently
apparently
```
index = inputLine.find('"', index++)
```
vs
ivs
```
index = inputLine.find('"', index);
index++;
```
.
.
.
was postfix increment operator handling
so apparently the issue
okay
my substring indexing was off
for some reason
run the code differently
that different compilers
is it possible
FORK
serious help
i need help
halp

but not
something work on ide

WHY
FUCK

wrong answer
and it's giving me
with floating point values
i have to do subtraction
<@352838592349077504>
i hate this language
who the FUCK designed this language
and not index
by length
is substring
in c++
whyu
<@352838592349077504>
funny color
.
i also wrote the text in discord
unluck
o
i get true
or sorry
i get false
and pass p&
so if i void etjamSmells(bool p&)
just p
i pass
no
that prints false
int main() {
bool p = false;
etjamSmells(p);
cout << p;
}
void etjamSmells(bool p) {
   p = true;
}
i send
so example
bruh
wtf is a reference variable
i need parentehese
and when i call function statically i also can't be like 
int main() {
function;
}
i have to have function() like every other language
right
void function {
cout << "hi"
}
like i can't
i hate life
chatgpt lie
wait no
what kinda crap is that
in functions
optional
parentheses
are fucking
in c++

the cs department here sucks
that's craazy

I PUT TRUE
THIS TEACHER SUCKS ASS
I GOT IT WRONG
WHAT THE FUCK
true/false
<@352838592349077504> what am i missing
Consider the following two code snippets:

if ( score > highScore )
  cout << "New high score!" << endl;
  cout << "Great score!" << endl;
if ( score > highScore ) {
  cout << "New high score!" << endl;
}
cout << "Great score!" << endl;
These two code snippets are interchangeable; that is, they produce the same terminal output for all values of score and highScore.
idk if that was the move
you have an "r" in your status

YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
I HAVE A STEERING WHEEL
WAIT
https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds
wtf is a symbol table...
and whatever is there is there already
it allocates memoryh
right
int x;
so when you initialize
WHY
THEN you get a compile-time error?
cout << x << endl;
int y = 2;
but if youy just do
wait what
such a horrific language ong
bruh
cout  << x << endl;
int x;
yeah
this language sucks
it just prints nonsense
no compile-time error right
if you don't declare a variable
also question
wait
okay
bruh
r u positive

you can
what
i don't think you can do that in java either right
you can't declare like String a = "2" right
right
int a = 2;
when you declare a variable
so
<@352838592349077504>
boolean canSungCode() {
    return false;
}

int main() {
    cout << canSungCode() << endl;
    return 0;
}
.
.
.
like it's not even the pointer stuff we're not even close to there yet
if they ask for cout << and you give me fucking printf()
bro

did you know a 6 pack of oreos is a great way to add 300 calories to a shake
just me.
just me?
no?
‚Äú9000 cal 250g protein‚Äù
and it‚Äôs like
with the dogs
yk those reels on instagram
TRUE
add protein powder
that‚Äôs grosser
but also protein
sounds gross
i already don‚Äôt eat

i cri
i try
at some point i was bottom 0% weight for height
super skinny is an understatement
too much cardio
i will never touch stairmaster.
u forget i weigh 2 pounds

CALF RAISES
google says
‚Äúhow to strengthen shin‚Äù
solution: strengthen shins
‚Äúshin pain during calf raise‚Äù
i looked it up
.
now think about if the food were twice as bad
u wanna eat georgetown food
?
except sophomore*
back to where i started
freshman -15
food is shit
i‚Äôm gonna go back to school
i‚Äôm up like 10-15 pounds
.
.
.
.
u also forget i weigh like half a pound so my calves are like an inch wide
.
not that much
155
bruh
yeah
also i get like broken blood vessels on my shoulders
but apparently that‚Äôs normal
also my shins hurt after
this one impedes my ability to walk the most
also out of all of the exercises
unlucky
we don‚Äôt have that
horrible exercise
my lower back gets squished
if i don‚Äôt fucking brace my core
tf u mean they are fun
standing calf raise
fuck this fucking thing
fuck calves
best lift ong
squat is king
everytime i go to squat i get really weird looks like ‚Äúno way this guy can squat a plate wtf‚Äù
i love this
ü¶ç
if u went gym this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue
unlucky
i shouldn‚Äôt have asked
ykw*
how

like whose idea was this
why do we have legs

who woulda thunk
1500 calories in a protein oreo milkshake

hwy would i do that
now
nbowo
should i play league
<@&851598406954647552>
i'm the chingaling
wait
i see says the blind man
so nextNeighbor() returns int -1 when it's null
i think i know what happened
wait
when we do breadth first search
each node has an int and a next node
adjacency list stores node objects
so
prof says check for neighbor == -1
when we do breadth first search with an undirected graph
the linked list in an adjacency list doesn't end at null?
<@230802920247918592>
i messed up data structure

it's just n!
wait no
or is that the same sequence
do i have to add + n
wait confirm
wtf
confus
or breadth
for depth
but for n there's freaking n! + n
so theres n for depth first
doesn't have to go in order
breadth first
wrong
wait no
bruh
cringe question
wtf
also n
and depth first
right
there are n possible sequences in breadth first because it goes through all and then it finds in 1 everytime
it's asking for possible sequences
wait hold on

also
right
so wait it's n + 1
and then one extra time and finds it
it goes through once n times
why is 2n correct for breadth first
lmao
oh wait
correct
ok so 2n corrent
but idlk y
yes/no?
n depth-first
2n breadth first
intuition

how to calculate number of depth first and breadth first search sequences
also
i'm in flush

didn't learn

we have breadth first and depth first search in our problem set

WAIT LMFAO I GOT THE RED BLACK INSERTION RIGHT BY GUESSING EASIEST 12 POINTS OF MY LIFE
building max heap of a sorted array is done in worst case O(nlgn) right
also
IM SO FUCKING DONE
AND GIVES US RED BLACK INSERTION ON TEST
PROFESSOR SAYS NO RED BLACK INSERTION ON TEST
FUCKING
rutgers bad
i‚Äôm so scared
bruh
is ur mom gonna spy on u
do u get pay
fum
wait
chong
it was easy
i like that quedstion
it's just an insertion algorithm
cong ming
wait i got it
i just check to see whether it is to the left or the right of the root
i guess instead of compareTo
oh wait
i didn't look on the final tho
there was none of this post order preorder stuff
i have no idea how to implement
what if i have to implement
but also
it's logic
right
idk how to express that in pseudocode
but like
which i guess is the algorithm
i just like "oh it's to the right/left of this number"
but i like don't think algorithmically
i hate rutgers
and i recursively call 1.right = (algo with inorder 637, post order 673)
so like i put 1 as root bc it's the end of postorder adn that's how that works
or two subarrays
i looked up the algo and it's like i split the inorder into two trees
but i don't have a clear set of steps
and refer to the inorder where it logically has to go
so i just go backwards from post order
and i brute force it
u get that
no u didn't
make tree
postorder: 84526731
given an inorder: 48251637
you can make a fumny tree
or preorder and inorder
if ur given postorder and inorder
but like
i know that
o
2. split inorder into two arrays based off of post order
1. root is end of postorder
but it like don't make sense in brain
i looked it up
i kinda just wing it and check
do i need to know an algo for that
is there really a month of content after hash tables
idk what else they teach
.
.
.
august 18
or maybe i just didn't understand linked lists
he's on leetcode easy while i get leetcode medium questions
wtf etjam
etjam old tests were so easy compared to my last test like
also bruh
balanced bst only matters in terms of everything is lgn instead of n
just bsts
that is like one of the two questions u got wrong lmfao
i just looked at ur old test
algorithm
did u ever do inorder and postorder to tree
<@230802920247918592>
wizard101
to play
u learned assembly
fake subject
cs
learn
so why
.
and postfix infix and expression trees we do BY HAND and it's 25% of the material
which i mean heaps are easy
they never taught us the implementation of heaps just the pseudocode
bruh
i hate cs
but red black trees are balanced
right
right
wo cao
red black trees are balanced by definition right
uhhhhh
and i was like
what is balanced tree
they just asked
no
right
it'd be a normal tree if the numbers were fucked
bst is only that when like collapsed everything on the left is less and on the right is greater is it not
why not
wut
what is that for heaps
sink swim
that's not worst case
wut
wdym
which means u have to go from root to bottom
right
and delete is also bottom
so u have to iterate to the bottom
it's at the bottom of the tree
i mean worst case insert right
and that's the reason red black trees exist
so they're all at worst O(n)
yeah
worst case insertion is at the bottom anyways
for worst case
and deleting bc u need to search
i mean inserting is also the same
searching
also is worst case scenario for bsts always just a linked list
what is a balanced tree
quick

so bugged
luckily internet is 200 up and down
and i put it up at 4
it‚Äôs not done yet

it was vacuum sealed

my mom reaches over and is in minecraft for some reason
it was like 4 blocks plus slanted
i was scared to make jump to base
the parkour was like slanted tho so the blocks weren't straight
we had parkour to our base
so i was first person steve

like instadie if fall
over like a HUGE ravine / cave system
we were minecraft base
weird dream
my minecraft launcher is like permastuck
if you'd like
for fun
you can open it up again
(i blocked it off)
i can make fun of ppl if they don't read the message
no
if u wanna finish the road
there's a shulker with packed ice
you will end up in lava off of a cliff
it's not finished
don't take it
the straight ice road might look complete from the start toward our home portal
<@230802920247918592>
for those playing on the server
we can make a shulker farm

the villagers don't recognize the zombie

cring
o
sour cream is fum
fumny
i j think it'll be funny
no i don't
no
in a bowl bowl
can i have that sour cream
W
smoge
bruh
so extra covered
get extra sides
add rice
oops no rice
give extra
i ask for meat first
i go to etjam
i go to chipotle
so here's the plan
L
o
or the sides
do u work the front w the meat and stuff
so
in a bowl bowl
yeah but like
can i just have an entire bowl of sour cream
W
o
samwich
mmmm
gg
oops i forgot to add rice
do ppl do that
genius
LOL
i'll wait for them to take like a bathroom break
ring it up yourself
just
well
oops
.
did u say no
no
and u should have said
and i'm p sure the distillery and stuff all use 16k max
i can use like 5 cables vs 100 cable
well that's like difficultish
but the pump is running slow
i think we switch all the MV to HV at the diesel pump
i think it's 2x
redstone flux
but it hasn't discharged any RF
it uses RF to charge

and it doesn't have durability
.
space suit gives 20 armor
also
plz
plz
plz
and everything
and give me extra protein
mega pack the bowl
like
will u pack the bowl
during the week
if i go to mall chip
i work monday through friday
bruh
there's a lot of
like in a week
not today
yeah mekanism is enabled
i think mekanism is enabled
o
i have no clue what that is
no
so unlimited water and lava
so we don't need squeezers
also we have ender tank
o
yeah
the pump made like 4 buckets in 30 mins
i already hooked it up to the home system
and we def don't have diesel
to make kerosene
but we need more diesel
galacticraft looks fun tho
luminescence gives 2 per stardust
nope
it took like way too much stardust
it was hard enough making extended crafting gold
the creative crafting table or whatever
also the new achievements are like impossible
igh
so we can "forget" his oxygen tank
and etjam
in like 15 mins
but we have the infrastructure for you to make it
like tin and copper and bronze and stuff
a million resources to make a rocket
it takes like
weirdchamp
so
also we have ME
executed in under 10 seconds
and i thought of the "quickly grab the rocket and the launchpad from the space rover -> get fuel loader and batteries and fuel tank out of backpack -> load rocket -> leave"
so i logged off
<@230802920247918592> do u want to help start a civilization on the moon
I FORGOT MY OXYGEN CANISTER AND I ALMOST DIED ON THE MOON
HOLY SHIT LMAO
https://medal.tv/games/minecraft/clips/p8LvB4q76L1eD/d1337DLxcA9Z?invite=cr-MSw2bGksMjQxODU1MTcs
i has rocket

and i think we get the energizer or whatever it's called next age too
and that takes too many fluix crystals
the chests we already have
so we need the chest
we have to use ME storage bus
no
i might go moon first bc i need to go to next age in order to get ME drives
i think i'll have enough to go to moon
sean should i wait to go to space until u get back
yes
i thought that was some weird biome lmao
o that thing
we need a lot of blaze powder for galacticraft
or mark it in the atlas
<@352838592349077504> before tm can u get me the coords of the nether fortress

nope

i would never use fossil fuels
and the thermal generator wasn't hooked up
so it ran out of power
the pump j didn't work bc plastic didn't allow diesel to flow into generator
<@352838592349077504> nvm we have diesel

might also be my isp so i'll probs call them later
and we casn see if the crash is the same
whenever u have time
if it crashes lmk

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.

i'm fucked
practice test
<@&711036942694875166>
there's area under the x-axis and over the x-axis do we just ignore it
so there's a question in my book that says find the area between y=1 and y=x^2 - 3
question
so it's -(a-b)
but the last integral is just the additive inverse of -2 to 3
it's a - b when it's 3 to 4 and -2 to 3
so it's going backwards
from 3 to -2
s
it'
damn it
one that ur not using tm
as in
<@689840590237597700> do u by any chance have 2 ti nspires
idk whatv

W
tm
r u still taking the ap
<@436618516154810389> r u still sick

or wait can u do it both ways
i got it backwards
yeah it's 10-7 <:ohmegalul:833507901213245460>
hold up
or not 7-4 lmao
it's 7 - 4 = 3
same thing
yeah
it's a formula
that i haven't reviewed
that thing lmao
right
is it 3
i think it's ftc
wait ethan i thought u were doing the thing
lulW
required
bc i have stuff saturday afternoon
do we have post prom plans
welcome to the club
bc nondif
which can't be 0
b is juist the limit def of the derivative
so it's c/2x
so the numerator always has to equal 0
f(x) = f(-x) because the function is even
0/2
?
l'hopitals
0/2x
pointy
without the frqs
i just got 55% on my practice test for physics lmfao

<@324018941221535744> dress up darling is weirdly wholesome

no bruh
just use laptop for word processing and ipad for writing/drawing if ur into that
jaden has a laptop alrdy right

there's a bit more time
also they're due on the 14th now
the recs are from the teachers
the school reports are from febles
both
yeahg
idk how popular the program is

<:nickCringe:805832351971409930>
bc i‚Äôm a tech guy lmfao every computer thing i have is overkill
i j think it‚Äôs overkill
no i like my pro
my ipad is huge it can‚Äôt be an air
no i have a pro
oops
and u can‚Äôt store programs
because the file storage system on ios and ipados are awful
it‚Äôs j hell
external storage for apple devices that aren‚Äôt macs is a bad idea
i‚Äôll tell u
it‚Äôs good
a little bit
paperlike
and the screen is slightly brighter on the pro
i just looked
is mainly the camera
the difference
honestly still probably works on the air
you save like 200 bucks for twice the storage
magic keyboard is slightly overkill if u have a laptop
the other one is called the magic keyboard
the smart keyboard is the folio no?
wb 128 pro
how much is 256 air
it‚Äôs what‚Äôs economical for storage
processing power is comparable for what ur doing
j look at the specs and decide
it will never be a laptop
bruh
how many programs do u have
how
it‚Äôs sufficient
get the air

recursively call 1.right = (algo with inorder 637, post order 673)so like i put 1 as root bc it's the end of postorder adn that's how that worksor two subarraysi looked up the algo and it's like i split the inorder into two treesbut i don't have a clear set of stepsand refer to the inorder where it logically has to goso i just go backwards from post orderand i brute force itu get thatno u
